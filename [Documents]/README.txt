~ The Story ~

    One day, a giant fire breathing fish, U.R.U.K, went to a contemporary art exhibition and was moved deeply by the paintings.
He was moved so deeply that he decided to destroy all rooms of some buildings in town... Just leaving a single room.
However, since his fireball was coded to only follow a living human, you, a living human, will help him tidy up the buildings,
supporting U.R.U.K's first bold step as a contemporary artist.

    WASD to move
    SPACE to dash



All the rooms get blown up except for a single room... So "One Room" it is!
Also, the Sun is smiling, and some of U.R.U.K's voices were recorded by me.
