~ The Story ~

    It's winter in the year 2077, and you decided to make a giant snowman so that you can get popular and somehow win the presidential election of the United States.

But you figured out that normal snowman won't just do, and you needed something different.

Following your parent's advice, you decided to roll a snowball with animals in it, and make a super duper snowman then upload it to instagram! 
 
~ Controls ~

    WASD to move
    O to enter snowman building mode
    SPACE to drop snowball during snowman building mode



In the game, each time you drop the snowball to build a snowman, you must 'start' rolling a new, 'small' snowball from the beginning. As you roll it, the snowball gradually grows larger, symbolizing the progress you make with your efforts.
